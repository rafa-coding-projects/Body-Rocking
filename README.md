**Instructions to reproduce the results**

* Download this repo in order to have the same file structure.

* Run the model
  
  * Go to Scripts folder
  * In order to run one experiment, run the following command:
    
    ```bash
    bash run_automatic_testCNN.sh
    ```
    
* Run the evalution under the defined metrics, run_metrics.py
  
* Run compare_methods to generate the figures in the paper
